# About Finance App

It's just an Electron App with React frontends, and SQLCipher from @journeyapps. It's my self project aiming to make my manual tracking of my financials in and out be a little easier.


# Installation

Just run `npm install` then you can run it as dev using `npm run dev`, it will automatically run Vite+React development server and then Electron will use it as the frontend when it launches.
